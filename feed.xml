            <title>Samurai Cop</title>
            <description>This movie review sees Twotakes look back on one of their favourite bad movies: Samurai Cop, to celebrate the release of its sequel Samurai Cop 2. They kindly ask that you keep your wig on throughout.
Samurai Cop is a cop who has &amp;quot;mastered&amp;quot; the ways of the Samurai and must fight to take down a very strange drug gang in a series of baffling encounters. Along the way, our friend manages to make jokes, cut off limbs and discover the true meaning of friendship.

            <title>Into The Grizzly Maze</title>
            <description>In this short and sweet film review, Twotakes take a cheeky dip into whether you should check out or chuck out a movie called Into The Grizzly Maze (2015). Will Em and Dec give this film their full su-paw-t? Or will it be too much to bear? 
The film follows a character played by James Marsden (Cyclops from Xmen) who for some reason has to go somewhere where a grizzly bear is on the rampage. Along the way, we are surprised when he ends up encountering said bear!

            <title>Stay Alive</title>
            <description>In this film review Em and Dec discover the true horror that lies within their latest DVD disaster... A terrible movie. If this horror film was a sandwich it would be two layers of bread with a slice of stale bread in between and a old mayonnaise stain that looks slightly like Frankie Muniz&amp;#39;s face.
Moving on they seek to understand why jump scares are scary... Spoiler, they&amp;#39;re not, and why poor old Frankie agreed to this mess... They still have no idea.

            <title>Sydney White</title>
            <description>Em and Dec delve into the the bargain bin and find Sydney White, a self purported modern telling of Snow White. 
Join them in discovering a film so uninspiring that it will magically put you into an enchanted sleep then cheer your heroes as they take it out into the woods and leave to be eaten by whimsical woodland critters.

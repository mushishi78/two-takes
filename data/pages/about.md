TwoTakes is a channel featuring super hot couple Em and Dec, as they take on the film industry with their unique blend of piercing analysis and drunken observation. Main shows are:

### Bargain Bin Blunder

Fishing their luck in the murky depths of the local bargain bin, Em and Dec hand their evening over to fate and find out just why nobody wanted to buy the film in the first place.

### Two Takes Takes On

Coming at a film from two sides, Em and Dec catch the unwitting movie in a pincer movement of vivacious critique, exploring in detail what works and why.

### Check It Or Chuck It

Two Takes makes a passionate case for why you should check out or chuck out a particular film or TV show.

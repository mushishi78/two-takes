This movie review sees Twotakes look back on one of their favourite bad movies: Samurai Cop, to celebrate the release of its sequel Samurai Cop 2. They kindly ask that you keep your wig on throughout.

Samurai Cop is a cop who has "mastered" the ways of the Samurai and must fight to take down a very strange drug gang in a series of baffling encounters. Along the way, our friend manages to make jokes, cut off limbs and discover the true meaning of friendship.

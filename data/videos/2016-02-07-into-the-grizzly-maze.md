In this short and sweet film review, Twotakes take a cheeky dip into whether you should check out or chuck out a movie called Into The Grizzly Maze (2015). Will Em and Dec give this film their full su-paw-t? Or will it be too much to bear? 

The film follows a character played by James Marsden (Cyclops from Xmen) who for some reason has to go somewhere where a grizzly bear is on the rampage. Along the way, we are surprised when he ends up encountering said bear!

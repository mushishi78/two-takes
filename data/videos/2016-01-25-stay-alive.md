In this film review Em and Dec discover the true horror that lies within their latest DVD disaster... A terrible movie. If this horror film was a sandwich it would be two layers of bread with a slice of stale bread in between and a old mayonnaise stain that looks slightly like Frankie Muniz's face.

Moving on they seek to understand why jump scares are scary... Spoiler, they're not, and why poor old Frankie agreed to this mess... They still have no idea.

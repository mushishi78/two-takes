Let me tell you about a crazy little show that may have flown underneath your radar called Ricky and Morty. An anarchistic, belch infused, Sci-fi comedy full of time bending storylines, shocking twists and dark, dark humour- Rick and Morty is just hilarious fun!

The program follows the exploits of a boy named Morty who lives with his family. His grandpa Rick is a foul mouthed, narcissistic, megalomaniacal, scientific genius who is always inventing incredible gadgets to do awful, selfish things, all over the multi-verse; Imagine if you will, Professor Farnsworth but with the morals of Eric Cartman and you will be somewhere close to the mark. 

Rick is very much the antagonistic agent of chaos- wreaking havoc in a way which is quite delightful to behold. Unlike other comparable characters such as Homer, Bender, or Roger the alien, Rick is also the only person capable of calming the storms of madness he has conjured- in a typical episode, he causes a problem, stokes the fires of catastrophe while trying to solve the problem, and then finally brings things back to nearish normal through such sickening means that Morty becomes increasingly closer and closer to complete mental breakdown as the episodes go on.

The rest of his family bring a realistic grounding to the mad-cap adventures, as the action cuts from some kind of inter-dimensional sentient fart explosion, to the mum and dad bickering about something. The slightly miserable relationship of Mortys parents is a marriage failing on grounds of deep rooted lack of connection and real attraction. This counterpoints the main part of the show, adding a farcical dramatic tension, which makes everything all the more funny. It is almost as if the show is making fun of the mundanity of your life and your problems by contrasting choices of galactic importance with whether or not Mum is having an affair with the handsome assistant horse doctor (shes horse doctor). 

A pervasive theme is that of chaos theory- that one small action or decision, leads to a whole bunch of unexpected consequences and Rick is involved, shit escalates FAST. It is joyful watching events slide out of control like greased pig at a children's birthday party and lots of episodes can actually be quite hard to predict what will happen, which is certainly unusual for the episodic cartoon comedy format.

So what about our main characters?  Rick is a blasé, arrogant, extrovert- who dominates those around him. He seems to have a certain soft spot for Morty but can be ruthless in order to get his way. Rick also has a lot of fun, he basically uses his scientific chops to party his way around the galaxy- selling weapons to alien hitmen, and stealing precious time crystals from galactic federations, cavorting and generally acting as a law unto himself. His speech is constantly interrupted by burps and belches. I didnt even realise there was a difference between a burp and a belch before I saw this performance, but it is there. The burp is a brasher, higher, more tinny rasping sound, whereas the belch comes from deep inside the gut and spills out the corner of your mouth in acrid spirals. Rick spits out his words like chewing tobaccos between gulps and burps and belches and half choking sounds. This works well because he often has to explain things very quickly and these urgent messages are punctuated (and delayed) by these gaseous intrusions. He walks a knife edge of extreme competence and extreme incompetence- similar perhaps to Archer and therefore most plot points are driven/ resolved by Rick in someway or another.

Morty, on the other hand, is timid, anxious, not too bright and generally quite an unfortunate little boy. His voice is a nervous little whimper, and he is at the awkward pre-teen stage of development but despite this discovers a certain taste for the adventures he embarks on with Rick. This lukewarm enthusiasm usually freezes cold pretty sharpish however, as Morty does not react to stressful situations with much composure and struggles to keep up with his grandpas intellect when assessing a difficult situation. His relationship with Rick, does to some extent empower him but fate has a way of bringing him crashing back to earth. Sometimes Morty will try to stick up for himself to Rick but this has disastrous consequences. And so Morty, and us the audience are reminded- dont get too cocky kid, a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing!

The visual style of the show is bright and cartoony. Its wackyness shares much more in common with children's shows such as Adventure Time or Gravity Falls than more adult fare. This could be very misleading as Rick and Morty is a million miles from being suitable for kids (I remember when I was young, my dad accidentally rented the South Park Movie from blockbusters thinking it was a children's film& Woops!) Quite apart from the language in Rick and Morty, they could easily get nightmares from some of the dark shit that goes down! It is on Adult Swim which has lots of programs which look like they must be for children but contain adult only humour such as Robot Chicken so I suppose it must their thing. I think there is something inherently funny and naughty about making crude jokes presented in a style that is normally associated with children, a kind of corrupt nostalgia that adds to the overall experience.

One of my overall impressions of Rick and Morty is that it somehow feels like more than the sum of its parts. The first series was made on a relatively small budget and was supposedly somewhat of a labour of love for the co-creators Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland (creator of Community and voice of Lemongrab from adventure time- respectively). This scrappy outsider feel comes through in the finished work, by which I mean; it has many conventional elements that come together to create something unconventional. In fact in many ways, it can be seen to be subverting these conventions and playing with the sci-fi tropes we are all familiar with. Often time Morty will be expecting or acting in a way that is in line with these narrative cliches and Rick will stop and berate him- why would you think that would work like that Morty?! pointing out the absurdity of certain tropes and then of course we get to laugh at them backfiring on poor Morty.

This twist on your expectations gives the jokes extra punching power and gives the allure of an exciting edginess, rather than broad strokes crassness. It sits in, and happily occupies a little niche that you never knew you needed- like a child of futurama that grew up, got a leather jacket, a motorbike and now just wheelies around, flipping the bird and playing slide guitar solos with a beer bottle. Maybe it isnt timelessly entertaining, and its heritage is worn on his sleeves, but while caught up in the moment it is undeniable, smile inducing fun. Plus, its great to stick it to the old timers- it satirises its predecessors with a joyful savagery that they once did for their predecessors, and so on it goes, the circle of comedy and moves us all.

A great example of this is found in one of my favourite episodes, when Morty is going to his high school prom, and asks Rick to make him a love potion so he can seduce the girl of his dreams. So pretty standard set up- a storyline we has seen done plenty of times- so I guess it will probably be something about Morty learning he should have confidence in himself- because no-one will respect you till you respect yourself, and that is the greatest love potion of them all, but that you should also offer respect to others and their wishes if they do not feel the same way that you do& NOOOPE! 

Actually all hell breaks lose and as the narrative hurtles out of control into a boiling pot of armageddon and multidimensional genocide and the moral lesson becomes one of far more reaching profound proportions- Mortys desire is responsible for terrible events and he must either accept or reject that guilt- I do not want to give too much away as you should definitely see it but the ending is balmy, wickedly hilarious- reveling in the absurd misery of the events and leaves the characters permanently affected. 

The second series is halfway through airing at time of writing and the quality has not dropped off- there are a few episodes that do not hit home quite as hard as others, but you get that with all shows to a certain extent- the ones that do are quite incredible- I feel like some have a premise you could get a whole film out of, crammed into 20 minutes of pure unadulterated amusement and I do not see them running out of ideas anytime soon because with a sci-fi premise that has already introduced time travel and interdimensional exploration, the tardis doors are wide open for fantastical plots of all kinds.

Ill leave you with a favourite quote from the show:

> nobody exists on purpose; nobody belongs anywhere; everyone is going to die; come watch TV.

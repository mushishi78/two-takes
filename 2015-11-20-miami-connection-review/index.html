      <div itemprop='articleBody' style='color: #fff'><p>Miami Connection (1987)</p>
<p>The setting is Miami, Florida. A city gripped by drug gang violence.
Enter our heroes, just your everyday 80s synth-rock band who just so happen to be black belts in TaeKwonDo.
All they want to do is spread their message of peace and friendship and tell the world that TaeKwonDo is life, but when bass-guitarist John starts going steady with the sister of the local gang leader a deadly chain of events involving Ninjas who ride motorbikes is begun...</p>
<p>There is always a slight heady rush of anticipation that commandeers my senses when I sit down to watch a film which lists one person predominantly across the credits. In this case Y.K.Kim makes it into the writing, producer, acting and casting credits (although he is uncredited he also directed a scene at the end of the film, but more about that later). This does not necessarily mean the film is going to be bad, far from it in many cases, but it does mean there will be a certain single minded drive to it. One persons view on the world given public platform for all to see, bypassing all the checks and balances that a team of professional peers might bring to the mix. In some cases this might mean a brilliant writer/director is able to push the envelope of contemporary drudgery, smashing expectations and changing the game for all the big Hollywood filmmakers for years to come&amp; Most of the time, however, you get Miami Connection.</p>
<p>Something you cannot help but notice about Miami Connection is that it was made in the 80s, it is an 83 minute all out assault of chest hair, mullets, and epic rock anthems. It almost seems to exist in the Waynes World universe 5 years early and theyre playing it straight, without the knowing winks to camera that Myers comically delivers. This film is literally bursting with earnest intent, wearing its misdirected heart on its vest- top- sleeve. There is something so heartwarming about how clumsy its pretensions to have a message are; when it finishes with a text message reading: 
Only through the elimination of violence can we achieve world peace<br>I did not know whether to laugh or to cry. In the end I laughed because it was so at odds with what I had just seen to the point of ridiculousness!</p>
<p> The film is set in Miami but shot in Orlando and Ive read somewhere that Y.K. Kim was so popular in Orlando the authorities let him film where-ever he wanted without requiring a permit. Im not sure why the film is set in Miami if that is true, seems like a bit of a slap in the face after such generosity but maybe Miami is considered more edgy or a more suitable setting for such high-voltage ninja/gang/rock antics, I have no idea being an ignorant Brit. But enough of circling around this like a ninja on a motorbike ambushing an 80s rock band made up of black belts in tae kwon do (That is a legitimate analogy from now on) let&#39;s get down to what makes this film so bad it is great!</p>
<p>Miami Connection opens with some kind of shady looking gang, wielding sub-machine guns and  standing around in a GTA Vice City villa, but the film wastes no time to establish characters or interest before a gang of ninjas dart in and set about mercilessly killing the gangsters with an arsenal of archaic ninja weapons such as swords, shurikens and a bow and arrow. Its funny how in films if opposing forces clash, the ones with guns with always succumb to those wielding bows and arrows, but given a choice who in the right mind would choose a sword over an Uzi!? Perhaps they prefer the silent approach, I just dont know. There is some gratifying violence and the action seems well polished and performed but so far it could be any generic ninja movie spurned out by the likes of Godfrey Ho on an uninspired day when he isnt having fish exploding into ninjas. But wait! Waa? as they make their escape the ninjas saddle up onto an array of motorcycles and speed off enigmatically (and noisily) into the night&amp; Well so much for the silent approach, but hey this film just got interesting! </p>
<p>A lot of the dialogue in the film is badly dubbed which can be pretty funny, however, when its not being dubbed it is somehow even worse. Conversations between characters are drowned out by background extras in some scenes and there are many scenes involving groups of characters such as gang members or band members where they all seem to be ad-libbing and talking at the same time and so you cannot make out a word anybody is saying. This is not really as big a problem as you might think since 90% of the dialogue is aimless chit-chat which does nothing to move the story along or develop the characters. One scene that particularly stands out is one where the moustachioed lead guitarist of the band Tom (played by Angelo Jannotti whose name seems to have been tragically misspelled on the IMDB page) hands out mail to his band mate/ flatmates. They are sitting around with their tops off, eating breakfast and he reads out all of the mail, carefully handing it out to all the right people, then the scene ends. Nothing important happens apart from the audience is further shown a cute insight into the daily life of the world&#39;s strangest but most loving family. The only other thing I can think of that this scene achieves is that it establishes that they get mail, which, boy oh boy, certainly comes back into play is a BIG way but as far as setups go it seems a bit unnecessary. </p>
<p>This theory definitely has legs because it would not be the only deft directorial set up on display. The boys from the band practice sparring with Y.K. Kim on a lawn somewhere, in a scene which really seems to drag on and on... This scene had better have some kind of significance later on!! I complained to my long suffering companion in B-movie watching Emma, and lo and behold their training move is later used to grisly effect in the climactic fight scene at the end of the movie. The climatic fight scene was not, however, in the original cut of the film and was later shot without the director Woo-sang Park by Y.K. Kim himself! So maybe the deft directorial move was simply an afterthought? Or an accident? I fear I will never really know but I like to think Kim knew what he was doing all along.</p>
<p>There does seem to be a nod towards good directing spattered about this film like fake blood off a ninjas sword, and these moments really stand out because the rest of the film is made up of long drawn out montages set to synth rock music or long drawn out scenes of the band playing synth rock music which seem to just be time filler in between the next gang-brawl fight scene. My favourite of the former was definitely a bemusing montage of mangy bikers hanging out in a biker bar, doing wheelies and getting drunk, set to a cheesy rock song with the lyrics: When things are getting rough, and you know youve had enough, you need the right stuuuuff, to be a tough guy, tough guy!  I definitely found myself not paying any attention to half the dialogue scenes which is perhaps a shame because there are some really brilliant lines hidden in there like: 
I didnt know you had a father? and TaeKwonDo is life. 
The highlights of the film are definitely found in the action scenes which are actually surprisingly well done although get a bit repetitive after a while.  The Formula basically seems to go like:</p>
<p>TaeKwonDo rockers cruising in their white convertible until they are ambushed by a gang who have formed some kind of road block
Gang are standing or sitting around doing menacing things like sharpening knives or exposing their hairy chests and navels and rocking bandannas with biker leathers. 
The band meekly drives up to the road block and calmly stop in front of it, making no attempt to drive away or turn around
The gang stalk over to the car baseball bats in their hands
Some indecipherable dialogue 
Y.K. Kim flying kicks out of the car and the band set about beating the mullets off the hapless gang members.</p>
<p>I swear this scenario seems to happen at least 3 or 4 times, although I might be missing some of the subtle deviations because I was barely following the plot beyond the basic overview owing to not being able/ having the will to understand half the dialogue! </p>
<p>Anyway, this film is best enjoyed with friends of a similar mind. The laughter you can have will easily outstrip a Hollywood so called comedy. And most excitingly of all, the full soundtrack is available online to stream. This may not sound so thrilling right now, but once you know how amazing the songs are in this accidental masterpiece, come back here and click the link below. I myself have been listening on a loop whilst writing this review and Im not crazy, Im the only one who isnt crazy so shut up!</p>

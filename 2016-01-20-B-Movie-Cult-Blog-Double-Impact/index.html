      <div itemprop='articleBody' style='color: #fff'><p>Cult night was a packed affair 20/01/2016 as we settled in for the first meeting of the new year.</p>
<p>Double Impact was an early  90s film in which Jean Claude Van Dam plays two twins who are separated whilst young because their parents are murdered. Why were they murdered? We were not paying attention closely enough not know- but it seemed a bit like the set up of batman.</p>
<p>The film was generally quite mild... the highlights included:</p>
<p>Evil twin constantly smoking a cigar so you know he is evil.
The complete and utter destruction of anything made of glass- once we noticed this it became more and more more funny- culminating in a scene in which we were sure a fish tank would be smashed, but it wasn&#39;t, but then suddenly we went back and it was thoroughly exploded
Really baggy 90s style suits
Jean did the splits
Jean kept mentioning his adequate penis size in a case of The Lady Doth Protest Too Much!
End scene involves our good guys: two hulking muscley martial artist brutes, chasing and killing the baddies: two old, frail looking men who stood absolutely no chance... Erm YAY</p>
<p>Overall, the film was a solid start to the year, but by no means the best/worst movie we have seen. This means we have room to improve though so there are no complaints here!</p>
